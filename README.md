Native libraries rewritten in pure Swift with an open license

The purpose of this project is two-fold:

1. To Swift-ify the Objective-C-Based frameworks.  i.e. write wrapper code that allows for more idiomatic Swift than is currently possible when using Coccoa, Foundation, etc..
2. To promote the adoption of Free Software in the Swift Community
